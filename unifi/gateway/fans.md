# Replacing the Security Gateway fans

The fans on the Security Gateway Pro 4 are not very noisy, but quite annoying. They are not temperature controlled and always running at full speed,
sending high frequency piercing sounds over long distances. Fortunately, replacing them is a very easy operation.

## What you need

* Two compatible 4cm fans, for instance [Noctua NF-A4x20 FLX](https://www.proshop.no/Kabinettkjoeler/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Kabinettvifte-40-mm-15-dBA/2595710).
* A small screwdriver.
* A desire to probably void the warranty by opening the cabinet. (The operation is easily reversed if though, if you don't throw away the original fans.)

## What to do

[Amusing instructions in Swedish.](https://www.sweclockers.com/galleri/14817-en-tyst-router-ar-en-bra-router)

1. Detach the power cord.
2. Unscrew three screws from the back of the cabinet and lift off the lid
3. Detach the original fan cables, unscrew two screws for each fan and remove them.
4. Fasten the new fans using their screws (unfortunately, there's no room for the vibration free mounts).
5. Connect the new fan cables (optionally using speed down adapters, I used NA-RC10 to speed down from 5000 to 4400 rpm).
6. Attach the power cord to test that the fans are working.
7. Put the lid back on and reattach it.

Estimated time: 20-30 mins.

Totally worth it!
