# Arming the house alarm and reading temperature sensors

I use [this custom component](https://github.com/gjohansson-ST/sector) to read the temperature of all my Sector Alarm sensors and also arm/disarm the alarm system.

Note: The alarm hub must be connected to the network (using an ethernet cable) in order to get temperature readings.
