# Power information via Tibber

[Tibber](https://tibber.com/no) is a Norwegian power company focused on "Smart Homes and the Green Wave". Their prices are somewhat competitive, but they have
designed and developed [Tibber Pulse](https://tibber.com/no/produkt/pulse) which connects to your meter and sends data back to Tibber.

If you want to become a Tibber customer, please use my [invite code](https://invite.tibber.com/6e73253e) to give us both 500 NOK for smart appliances.

## Home Assistant

Home Assistant has the [Tibber (cloud) integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tibber/) which adds lots of power related sensors, including power usage and prices.

## Other integrations/power ups

Tibber also connects with my Mitsubishi heaters (using MELCloud), turning their effect up and down during the day, taking the outdoor temperature and current prices into account.

They also integrate with various other heating devices and electric car chargers.
